# Phishing-Website-Detection

Phishing websites, a prevalent form of social engineering, mimic trusted URLs and webpages to deceive users. This project aims to develop machine learning models using a curated dataset to predict phishing websites. The dataset comprises both phishing and legitimate URLs, from which essential URL and website content features are extracted. The performance of each model is evaluated and compared to determine their effectiveness in detecting phishing websites.
